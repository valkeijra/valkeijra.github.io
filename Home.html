            <h1>Alma Pettersson</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a recently graduated programming student looking for my first job within the game industry.
                I've programmed since I was 14 years old and have since then been driven by my passion  and interest for technology and video games.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                My main skills are C# and Unity but Ive always had a knack for learning and can quickly adapt to a new game engine or a new programming language.
                Except for C# and Unity I also have basic knowledge in JavaScript, Python, PhP, HTML, CSS, GameMaker and GML aswell as experience working with databases and SQL.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                Many of these skills have been used in order to create this website wich I've coded completely on my own. 
                I hope you enjoy my porfolio and that I can peek your interest with my skills and experience!
