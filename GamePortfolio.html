            <p>All of my projects in this portfolio are personal passion projects that I've developed as a part of my education and/or during my own free time.
            This portfolio mainly showcases my skills in C# and Unity but as a flexible and adaptive programmer I can easily transfer these skills into other software or languages.</p>
            <p>As a system oriented programmer I'm proficient in developing core gameplay features with a modular design to allow for easy expansion and future development in my projects.
            I've also developt tools for other group memebers of different disciplines and made my code easy to handle and work with for designer, artists and other programmer alike.</p>

                            Pax Romana is an ongoing personal project that I'm developing together with friends from Högskolan i Skövde.
                            The game is a paradox inspired grand strategy game with a heavy focus on economy, excluding the combat and warfare that is usually present in these types of games.

                        </br>
                        <p>
                            During this project I've been responsible for alot of the programming work, specificly the underlying systems that drive the gameplay experience forward.
                            I've also worked together with the other programmer in our group to design and implement different systems like buildings, trade ect. that the player can directly interact with.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            Since this project might be something we would wanna release in the future it is not open source.
                            I have however compiled a more detailed portfolio for the project with some samples of code and a presentation that details my work.

                            Wasted Alien was made for a game jam together with a friend, I was the only programmer on the project whilst my partner was responsible for the design and graphical elements of the game.
                            It's a simple idle game with point and click controls, the main goal is to supply your extraterrestrial customers with weird and fun drinks by mixing and preparing different ingridients.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            As the sole programmer I was responsible for almost all of the coding. The main challenge was to make a solution that was modular 
                            but also easy to work with for my partner since they had to do alot of the implementation work in unity.
                            During the project I made tools and systems for my friend so they could quickly and easily implement new drinks, customers and ingridients.

                        <p>
                            This project was developed during a 48h time span with some time spent afterwards to make it more presentable for my portfolio.
