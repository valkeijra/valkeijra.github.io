            </div>

            <p>
                I grew up in rural Västra Götaland, Sweden on a horse farm were I've lived for most of my life.
                I've always had to fight for my interest in technology and video games which has made my passion and interest even stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a person who always want to keep learning and evolving and the next step in that journey is starting my career as a programmer.
                I will bring my talent, passion and willingness to grow into my work life as I take the step to apply all my knowledge and experience in a practical setting.
            </p>
